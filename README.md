Exercise 2
## Motivation
The work involves training a dataset of handwritten digits (the MNIST data set) using a pre-trained deep learning architecture such as VGG16.
This is a contribution as part of the technical assessment for the position of machine learning scientist for a quantum computing based startup- Multiverse Computing.

## Code environment
Python 3.6
Jupyter notebook (Anaconda environment) OR
A system with GPUs such as google collab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)

## Code style
Preprocessing- reshaping, resizing, normalising the input data
Loading the base VGG16 model
Writing a top layer classifier
Training
Plotting the learning curves to evaluate the learning of the deep learning model.

## Features
The VGG network architecture was introduced by Simonyan and Zisserman in their 2014 paper, Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition.
It is a pre-trained network trained on an enormously huge image dataset (http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), learning parameters of which can be exploited to train your own image dataset.

## Installation
Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual),
Set up the required python image processing libraries from the command interface- pip3 install <<Library name>>
List of libraries-
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
keras
tensorflow
sklearn

Run the jupyter notebook environment from the anaconda software.
Navigate to the .ipynb file from the distribution.
Set up the correct data directory path for the train and test dataset files as per their location.

## Custom
The dataset can be changed as per the project and the graphs can be used to evaluate the learning of the system.
The ground truth labels of test data-set is not available so let be the predict phase.

## Credits
This is a contribution to Mr. Sam Mugel (PhD) CTO and founder: Multiverse Computing.
and Mr. Róman Orús (PhD) CSO and founder: Multiverse Computing.
